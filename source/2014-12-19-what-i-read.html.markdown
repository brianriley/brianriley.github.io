title: "What I read"

Lots of political stuff this week.

###### [The Truth About Anonymous's Activism](http://www.thenation.com/article/190369/truth-about-anonymouss-activism)

Especially enjoyed the historical context at the end. Wonder when the author will be doxed.

###### [Reaction to the Sony Hack Is 'Beyond the Realm of Stupid'](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/reaction-to-the-sony-hack-is-beyond-the-realm-of-stupid)

One of the better things I've read on the Sony hack and the reaction to it. It doesn't really matter if North Korea was the attacker: Sony can't sue them, and the US isn't going to go to war because some Sony execs were embarrassed. (I think.)

###### [Hollywood Hijinks and the Films of Empire](http://www.thebaffler.com/blog/hollywood-hijinks-and-the-films-of-empire/)

But let's say North Korea was responsible, and this is their reaction for _The Interview_, which they say is an act of war. Crazy, right? Except let's not forget that "entertainment is a tool of American statecraft."
